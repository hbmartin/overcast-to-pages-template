3. Find your login cookie and copy the value for `o`
   1. e.g. in Chrome under `Application` > `Cookies` > `https://overcast.fm`

4. [Add an action repository secret](https://github.com/hbmartin/overcast-to-pages/settings/secrets/actions/new)
5. Enter Name: `OVERCAST_COOKIE` and Secret: paste the `o` value from step #3
6. Click the green button `Add secret`
7. Go to [Pages Settings](https://github.com/hbmartin/overcast-to-pages/settings/pages) > `Source` (dropdown) > Choose `GitHub Actions`
8. Start your first [scrape run](https://github.com/hbmartin/overcast-to-pages/actions/workflows/scrape.yml) > `Run workflow` (gray button) > `Run workflow` (popup green button)
